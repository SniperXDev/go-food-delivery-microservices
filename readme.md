# üçï Go Food Delivery Microservices

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/SniperXDev/go-food-delivery-microservices)

> `Go Food Delivery Microservices` is an imaginary and practical food delivery microservices, built with Golang and different software architecture and technologies like **Microservices Architecture**, **Vertical Slice Architecture** , **CQRS Pattern**, **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**, **Event Sourcing**, **Event Driven Architecture** and **Dependency Injection**. For communication between independent services, We use asynchronous messaging using RabbitMQ, and sometimes we use synchronous communication for real-time communications using REST and gRPC calls.

**You can use this project as a template to build your backend microservice project in the Go language**

üí° This application is not `business-oriented` and my focus is mostly on the technical part, I just want to implement a sample using different technologies, software architecture design, principles, and all the things we need for creating a microservices app.

üöÄ This Application is `in progress` and I will add new features and technologies over time.

## Project Layout and Structure

Each microservices are based on these project structures:

- [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

## System Architecture

![](./assets/system-architecture-diagram.png)

## Application Structure

In this project I used [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) or [Restructuring to a Vertical Slice Architecture](https://codeopinion.com/restructuring-to-a-vertical-slice-architecture/) also I used [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) in this project.

- We treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
- When We add or change a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many different "layers" in an application. we are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice and each change affects only one slice.
- We `Minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.
- With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects. For implementing vertical slice architecture using cqrs pattern is a good match.

![](./assets/vsa2.png)

Also here I used [CQRS](https://www.eventstore.com/cqrs-pattern) to decompose my features into very small parts that make our application:

- maximize performance, scalability, and simplicity.
- adding new features to this mechanism is very easy without any breaking changes in another part of our codes. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.
- easy to maintain and any changes only affect one command or query (or a slice) and avoid any breaking changes on other parts
- it gives us a better separation of concerns and cross-cutting concerns (with the help of MediatR behavior pipelines) in our code instead of a big service class for doing a lot of things.

By using [CQRS](https://event-driven.io/en/cqrs_facts_and_myths_explained/), our code will be more aligned with [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), especially with:

- [Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) rule - because logic responsible for a given operation is enclosed in its own type.
- [Open-Closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) rule - because to add a new operation you don‚Äôt need to edit any of the existing types, instead you need to add a new file with a new type representing that operation.

Here instead of some [Technical Splitting](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) for example a folder or layer for our `services`, `controllers`, and `data models` which increase dependencies between our technical splitting and also jump between layers or folders, We cut each business functionality into some vertical slices, and inner each of these slices we have [Technical Folders Structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) specific to that feature (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, data models, ...).

Usually, when we work on a given functionality we need some technical things for example:

- API endpoint (Controller)
- Request Input (Dto)
- Request Output (Dto)
- Some class to handle Request, For example, Command and Command Handler or Query and Query Handler
- Data Model

Now we could have all of these things beside each other and it decrease jumping and dependencies between some layers or folders.

Keeping such a split works great with CQRS. It segregates our operations and slices the application code vertically instead of horizontally. In Our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.


### High Level Structure

## Formatting

In this app, I use [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) and for enforcing its rule I use [conventional-changelog/commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) and [typicode/husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) with a pre-commit hook. To read more about its setup see [commitlint docs](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#getting-started) and [this article](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-lint-commit-messages-with-husky-and-commitlint-b51d20a5e514) and [this article](https://www.code4it.dev/blog/conventional-commit-with-githooks).

For applying [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) in IDE level I use [intellij-plugin-golangci-lint](https://github.com/xxpxxxxp/intellij-plugin-golangci-lint) plugin.

For formatting, I used [mvdan/gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt), [goimports-reviser](https://github.com/incu6us/goimports-reviser), [golines](https://github.com/segmentio/golines) and [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/integrations/#goland) in my GoLand and for each package, there is a guide for how to set it up in your IDE, for example. [here](https://github.com/incu6us/goimports-reviser#configuration) is the configuration for goimports-reviser. 

Also, you can control this formatting with `husky` automatically before any commit by installing [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) in your dev environment:

1. Install Tools:
``` bash
make install-tools
```

2. Install NPM:

```bash
npm init
```

3. Install CommitLint:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli
```

4. Create the `commitlint.config.js` file with this content:

```js
module.exports = { extends: '@commitlint/config-conventional']};
```

5. Install Husky:

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
```

6. Add `prepare` command for installing and activating `husky hooks` that we will add in the next steps, in the [package.json](package.json) file:

```bash
npm pkg set scripts.prepare="husky install"
```

7. Create the Husky folder:

```bash
mkdir .husky
```

8. Adding hooks for linting and formatting before commit:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "make format && git add -A ."
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "make lint && git add -A ."
```

9. Adding CommitLint to the husky before commit:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit ${1}'
```

10. Activate and installing all husky hooks with this command:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

## Live Reloading In Development

For live reloading in dev mode I use [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) library. for a guide about using these tools, you can [read this article](https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/live-reloading-golang-using-air/).

For running each microservice in `live reload mode`, inner each service folder type the bellow command after [installing air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air?ref=content.mainawycliffe.dev#via-go-install):

```bash
air
```
