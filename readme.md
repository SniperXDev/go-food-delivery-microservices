# 🧺 Store Golang Microservices Sample

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod&style=flat-square&color=ff69b4)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/mehdihadeli/store-golang-microservices-sample)

> A practical store sample, built with Golang and different software architecture and technologies like **Microservices Architecture**, **Vertical Slice Architecture** , **CQRS Pattern**, **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**, **Event Driven Architecture**. For communication between independent services, We use asynchronous messaging with using kafka, and sometimes we use synchronous communication for real-time communications with using REST and gRPC calls.

🌀 This Application is `in-progress` and I will add new features and thecnologies over time.
